    <h2>Succession Planning</h2>
    <p>Succession planning allows owners to leave their business on their own timeframe while preparing their company to be transferred to family members, key employees, an outside party, or even a charity.

    <h2>Key Person Insurance</h2>
    <p>Key person life insurance offers a death benefit that helps indemnify an employer for the loss of one of its most important assets - the key person. This can help assure continuity of the business for employees, customers and creditors, and protects against losses in sales, momentum, and credit. It can also be used to assist with recruiting and developing a replacement for the employee.</p>

    <h2>Funding Buy-Sell Agreements</h2>
    <p>A buy&ndash;sell agreement is a legally binding agreement between co-owners of a business that governs the situation if a co-owner dies or leaves the business, whether by force or by choice. A funded cross-purchase buy-sell plan utilizes life insurance to help ensure that the arrangement is properly funded so that there will be money when the event is triggered.</p>

  <div class="pam-section">
    <h2>Funding Deferred Compensation</h2>
    <p>Deferred compensation is a written agreement between an employer and an employee where the employee chooses to have part of his or her compensation withheld by the company, invested on their behalf, and distributed back to them at a pre-determined point in the future. Deferred compensation can be used as a flexible way to attract and incentivize key employees.</p>
