Investing in an ETF will give the portfolio exposure to the securities comprising the index on which the ETF is based and will expose the portfolio to risks similar to those investing in those securities. ETFs are subject to market price risk. Shares of ETFs are traded on an exchange and will trade at market price, which may be above or below its net asset value (NAV). There is also a liquidity risk in that the trading of an ETF may be halted due to such things as market conditions. The investor will pay brokerage commissions in connection with the purchase of shares of ETFs.</p>
