    <h2>Tax Planning</h2>
    <p>You work hard for your money, so it is important to strategize your plan in a way that allows you to save the most. Although you may be unaware, there are most likely missed exemptions on your tax forms that require you to pay higher taxes than necessary. Let us help you change this by reviewing your taxes and finding missed deductions. Managing your taxes now can help you save long into the future, making goals such as a second home or early retirement possible.</p>

  <div class="pam-section">
    <h2>Retirement Planning</h2>
    <p>Retirement planning as a physician or other healthcare provider is crucial in order to stay on track and retire on time. Most careers only require 4-6 years of education, but the medical field requires so much more. While others can begin saving for retirement within years of exiting high school, individuals in the medical field can fall behind without proper planning. Our job is to take into account this longer period of education and help you manage your finances in such a way that retiring on time is made possible.</p>

    <h2>Education Planning</h2>
    <p>Planning for the education of your children can be overwhelming, especially when you have just finished paying off student loans of your own. Our team of advisors is prepared to work with you to take into account tuition growth, risks involved, taxes, and more to create a plan best suited to the needs of both you and your children. Sending children off to college is difficult enough; do not let your finances make it even harder. Talk to us about education financing today.</p>

    <h2>Debt Management</h2>
    <p>You would not be where you are today if it were not for hard work and years of education. Unfortunately, your education most likely left you with a hefty debt as well. We want to help you manage that debt in such a way that paying it off becomes not only possible, but also easy. As you look to the future, you should be excited, not worried. As you look back at your education, you should be grateful, not regretful. Our debt management programs will help meet your objectives so that your career, not your debt, can be the center of your focus.</p>

    <h2>Asset Protection</h2>
    <p>Unexpected events can happen at any given moment such as divorce, lawsuits, liability claims, and more. Our advisors are experts on asset protection so that your assets, wealth, home, savings, investments, and future income, are safe no matter what comes your way. Let us give you that sense of security knowing even if the unpredictable occurs, you will not lose your hard earned possessions and wealth.</p>

    <h2>Employee Benefits</h2>
    <p>In healthcare, every employee matters. No office can run smoothly without the help of administrative staff, managers, nurses, assistants, and other staff members. This team is what keeps clients satisfied, schedules complete, and priorities in order. Benefits ensure your employees are dedicated to staying with your practice. Although a need for income leads candidates to apply, it is benefits such as dental and medical insurance and leave time that motivate them to stay. Our job is to help you decide which benefits are best for your company and how to plan and implement them according to your company goals.</p>

    <h2>Insurance</h2>
    <p>With so many possibilities available today, picking the right one can be a complicated and frustrating task if attempted alone. A plan can make or break your business and your personal reputation depending on its coverage. The right plan can protect you, your assets, and your name in case of error or liability whereas the wrong plan can permanently damage your practice. Our advisors specialize in insurance and can assist you with choosing the correct type of coverage for your specialty.  </p>

    <h2>Disability Insurance</h2>
    <p>In an emergency in which the main provider of your family is no longer able to work, disability insurance protects your source of income so that your family still has a source of stability. When the ability to make future plans for investment (ex: school, cars, homes) based on the assumption of future income is taken away by illness or injury, our agents can help you protect your current lifestyle and long term goals. In addition to new medical expenses, one’s income is also reduced or even terminated at the onset of an illness or injury. As the main provider for your family, you should strongly consider disability insurance if your spouse does not believe he or she could maintain financial stability, pay the mortgage, or pay off expenses on your spouse’s income alone. </p>
