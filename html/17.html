  <p>Here at [[DBA]], we are able to help farmers, landowners and agribusinesses with financial planning and decisions because we understand what it takes to make a farm great, and the challenges in finances that many farmers face. Although all farms are <em>good</em>, what makes a farm <em>great</em> is its ability to succeed through future generations. With our assistance and guidance, you will never have to worry about the stability of your farm and its finances going forward.</p>

  <p>Landowners, agribusinesses, and farmers alike, all need specialized options when it comes to managing their money and protecting their assets. Our goal is to tailor every financial plan to the needs and goals of the individual in such a way that he or she feels confident with their legacy. </p>

    <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
    <p>As a farm owner, you need to be continually thinking about not only the present, but also the future. Your farmland is not a liquid asset and because of that, settlement problems may arise. The best way to ensure a smooth transition from one farm owner to the next is by estate planning. Essentially this is a framework for the disposition of your assets at the time of death. Not only will this protect your land, but it will also provide for the needs of your family and may help reduce high inheritance taxes. By creating an estate plan, you can go forward knowing your farm and your family will always be in good hands. </p>

    <h2>Succession Planning</h2>
    <p>When passing on a farm and all that comes with it, the farm and land owners have many important decisions to make regarding their future. Farmland can be passed on to relatives, employees, outside parties, and even charities. Even after this decision is made, however, many more remain. Succession planning with our team means making these decisions together and making sure your farm will remain economically sound and continue with the legacy you desire.</p>

    <h2>Asset Protection</h2>
    <p>Protecting your assets means getting to know you, your values, and your priorities. We want to know what is important to you and protect that from any unexpected occurrences in the future. Asset protection allows us to work with you to plan for the future, protect your farm and personal assets such as wealth, future income, and property from liabilities and guide the process of transferring assets on to future generations.</p>

    <h2>Investment Management</h2>
    <p>Investing in the future requires a lot more consideration than simply what assets you can allocate to a venture. We are sure to take all factors into consideration such as your personal timetable, risks involved, taxes, and more to help you invest smarter. </p>

    <h2>Charitable Planning</h2>
    <p>When a charity or organization matters to you, it also matters to us. No matter what your philanthropic passions are, we are here to help support them by creating a financial plan that includes charitable giving within its budget. Not only that, but as a result of your giving we may also be able to find tax deductions that end up saving you money as you give. In all areas of finance, even giving, our team of advisors can help make the most of your financial plan and wealth.</p>

  <div class="pam-section">
    <h2>Buy-Sell Agreements</h2>
    <p>A buy-sell agreement is a legally binding contract between co-owners of a farm that sets in place a plan in the case of one owners death or leaving of the business, regardless of the circumstances. Essentially this agreement provides a protected way out of farm ownership if needed. Our team works with you to employ life insurance in such a way that the business will not struggle financially even in the case of a co-owner’s death.</p>

    <h2>Key Person Considerations</h2>
    <p>A farm is only able to run its best when all of the employees and owners work together and share common goals. But what happens when a key-member of the team passes away? That is where our company can help, by providing a form of insurance that will compensate the farm owner in the case of a loss. This key-person insurance protects the farm from a loss of sales, credit, and work force and can be used to find another worker to take his or her place. When you think of your farm’s employees, is there one employee you cannot imagine working without? Does this member bring skills and ideas that no other employee can? If so, we can help you protect your farm even in the case of this worker switching employers, becoming disabled, or dying. </p>
